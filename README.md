# Exploring Biases in Academic Reviews through Data Analysis and Visualization
## Introduction
This project, inspired by the work of scholars from Stanford University, dives into an analysis of college professor reviews from RateMyProfessors.com, aiming to uncover potential language biases related to review quality and professor gender. Through the creation of specific classes for parsing and organizing a vast dataset of 19,685 reviews, participants will not only handle complex data structures but also engage in revealing trends via a straightforward data visualization tool.

The primary goal is to discern patterns in word usage across different contexts, bringing to light any inherent biases, especially gender bias, that might influence students' anonymous feedback. This insight is crucial, considering the substantial impact such reviews can have on professorsâ€™ academic and professional paths. The project is a hands-on journey from building foundational data structures to visualizing and understanding the subtleties of language in student feedback.
